Metadata Report
Page: TARGET URL
Score: 55/100

Key Findings
MEDIUM ‚Äî Title length (74 chars) exceeds recommended range, may truncate in search results
HIGH ‚Äî Meta description (243 chars) significantly exceeds limits and contains redundant content
HIGH ‚Äî Complete absence of Open Graph metadata impacts social media sharing
MEDIUM ‚Äî Missing language declarations affect accessibility and search engine understanding

Priority Fixes
Priority	Action	Why it matters
P0	Trim meta description to 120-155 characters by removing redundant phrases and improving flow	Current length will cause truncation and poor user experience
P0	Add complete Open Graph tags (og:title, og:description, og:image, og:locale)	Essential for proper social media sharing and engagement
P1	Add html_lang='en' attribute to html element	Improves accessibility and search engine language detection
P1	Optimize title length to 50-60 characters while maintaining key messaging	Reduces risk of truncation in search results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API Authentication Errors**
- Verify credentials are correctly configured in n8n
- Check credential names match those used in workflow nodes
- Ensure API keys have sufficient permissions
- Test credentials individually

**Firecrawl Extraction Fails**
- Check URL accessibility and robots.txt
- Verify Firecrawl API limits and usage in dashboard
- Review extraction parameters in workflow

**Anthropic Analysis Issues**
- Confirm API key has Claude access in Anthropic dashboard
- Check input data format and size limits
- Review custom prompts for syntax errors

**Email Delivery Problems**
- Verify SMTP credentials and settings in n8n

### Debug Mode
1. Enable "Save Execution Progress" in workflow settings
2. Check individual node outputs for errors
3. Use "Execute Node" for targeted debugging
4. Review n8n logs for detailed error messages
5. Test credentials individually in n8n

## API Rate Limits

Monitor usage in respective dashboards:
- **Anthropic**: Check usage in Anthropic Console
- **Firecrawl**: Monitor limits in Firecrawl dashboard (typically 500-5000 requests/month)
